## Description

*Book Search Engine is an application that allows the users to search for their desired books using Googlr publicly available API. The application uses MERN stack and it is connected by Apollo Server and Apollo Provider node packages. In this application the user has the option to signup, login and search for the books and there has the option to save the books, retrieve the saved books and also delete the books. Without login to the application, the user also has the option to search for the book, but at that time he/she will not have the option to save the books. This is a very updated and timely software.*

## User Story

```text
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```text
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app‚Äôs store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
